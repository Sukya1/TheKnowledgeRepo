# The Knowledge Repo
My first personal project using HTML and CSS. 
The website is in the style of a blog that I named The Knowledge Repo. 
This website will display a page that details 9 things I wish I knew as a CS major.

# Files 

## main.html 
Host the main page, links to other relevant websites and mailing list button 

## mailingList 
Host a form to join the mailing list and a submit button that leads to a thank you page

## thankYou.html
Thank you page that displays a gif

# Demo 
Here is a link to a video demo of the projet
